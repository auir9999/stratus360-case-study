My name is Ryan Wang, 4th year BSD (software development) student at Seneca College.  
This is my web app for the stratus360 case study assignment for the job interview portion.   
Link to the heroku deployment: https://stratus360-ryan-case-study.herokuapp.com/  
All changelogs and notes are noted down in the other MD file: [notes+changelog](https://github.com/auir9999/stratus360-case-study/blob/main/notes%2Bchangelog.md)
  
IMPORTANT NOTE: due to how the free version of Heroku operates, the storage is ephemeral and is incompatible with my working view count system, thus there are 3 iterations of my code.
 - code: the version deployed on heroku (with viewcount commented)
 - code - view count working on local: original implementation that fulfilled all criteria by deadline (heroku implementation error for free versions - found out on 30/10/2021)
 - code - attempted mongoose work around: attempt at implementing a mongoose server on the side to hold literally 1 mapping of comic num & view count, remains incomplete due to time constraints.
